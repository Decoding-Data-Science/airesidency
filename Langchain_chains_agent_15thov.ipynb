            "Summary: Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the total market value of all the final goods and services produced and rendered in a specific time period by a country or countries. GDP is often used to measure the economic activity of a country or region. The major components of GDP are consumption, government spending, net exports (exports minus imports), and investment. Changing any of these factors can increase the size of the economy. For example, population growth through mass immigration can raise consumption and demand for public services, thereby contributing to GDP growth. However, GDP is not a measure of overall standard of living or well-being, as it does not account for how income is distributed among the population. A country may rank high in GDP but still experience jobless growth depending on its planned economic structure and strategies. Dividing total GDP by the population gives a rough measure of GDP per capita. Several national and international economic organizations, such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, maintain their own definitions of GDP.\n",
            "GDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress. It serves as a statistical indicator of national development and progress. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. Nominal GDP is useful when comparing national economies on the international market using current exchange rate. To compare economies over time inflation can be adjusted by comparing real instead of nominal values. For cross-country comparisons, GDP figures are often adjusted for differences in the cost of living using Purchasing power parity (PPP). GDP per capita at purchasing power parity can be useful for comparing living standards between nations. \n",
            "GDP has been criticized for leaving out key externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work. Alternative economic indicators such as doughnut economics use other measures, such as the Human Development Index or Better Life Index, as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being.\n",

It is a federal semi-constitutional monarchy made up of seven emirates, with Abu Dhabi serving as its national capital while Dubai is the country's largest city. It shares land borders with Oman to the east and northeast, and with Saudi Arabia to the southwest; as well as maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran, and with Oman in the Gulf of Oman. As of 2024, the UAE has an estimated population of over 10 million, which is multi-ethnic. Islam is the official religion and Arabic is the official language, while English is the most spoken language and the language of business.\n",

The Portuguese Empire arrived in the region around 1500 and set up bases on the territory while waging wars against the Persians. After their expulsion, the Dutch controlled the straits and had established global maritime dominance. By the 19th century, with pearling becoming a major economy, piracy in the gulf caused by some local tribes caused the British to arrive, which led to the sheikhdoms forming a pact with them creating the Trucial States, effectively shielding the area from Saudi and Omani expansion that claimed suzerainty over it. The Trucial States remained a British protectorate until full independence as the United Arab Emirates in 1971.

While the term \"high-income\" is often used interchangeably with \"First World\" and \"developed country\", the technical definitions of these terms differ. The term \"first world\" commonly refers to countries that aligned themselves with the U.S. and NATO during the Cold War. Several institutions, such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or International Monetary Fund (IMF), take factors other than high per capita income into account when classifying countries as \"developed\" or \"advanced economies\". According to the United Nations, for example, some high-income countries may also be developing countries. The GCC countries, for example, are classified as developing high-income countries. Thus, a high-income country may be classified as either developed or developing. Although Vatican City is a sovereign state, it is not classified by the World Bank under this definition.\n",
